# 🧠 NLP & Data Analytics Projects

This repository includes multiple scripts exploring storm event data, natural language processing, regression analysis, and web scraping. Each script performs a distinct data analysis task. See below for a summary of each.

## 📄 Script Summaries

### 1. `LSaade_NLP_Exploration.py` 🗣️📊
- **Purpose**: Performs basic NLP on a narrative text file using NLTK.
- **Key Features**:
  - Tokenizes and cleans text from `narrative.txt`.
  - Removes stopwords.
  - Displays a frequency distribution of the top 25 most common words.

### 2. `LSaade_Python_for_Data_Analytics.py` 🐍🌩️
- **Purpose**: Analyzes 2020s storm data using pandas.
- **Key Features**:
  - Identifies the state with the highest number of weather events (Texas).
  - Highlights top 3 event types in Texas and their monthly frequency.
  - Visualizes distribution of events over time with a histogram.

### 3. `LSaade_R_for_Data_Analytics.R` 📈🌪️
- **Purpose**: R-based equivalent of Python storm data analysis.
- **Key Features**:
  - Identifies and plots the most affected state and event types.
  - Shows monthly distribution of top 3 event types.
  - Merges storm data across decades and visualizes frequency trends over time.

### 4. `LSaade_Regression.py` 📉🌡️
- **Purpose**: Conducts and visualizes linear regression on climate anomaly data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Reads weather anomaly data from CSV.
  - Fits a regression line to show trend over years.
  - Uses Seaborn and Matplotlib for scatter and regression plotting.

### 5. `Web Scraping.py` 🌐🌀
- **Purpose**: Scrapes and analyzes hurricane landfall data from NOAA.
- **Key Features**:
  - Extracts table data from NOAA’s website.
  - Outputs a CSV of hurricane landfalls.
  - Analyzes landfalls by month, year, max wind speeds, and storm categories.
  - Visualizes data trends over time using Seaborn.
